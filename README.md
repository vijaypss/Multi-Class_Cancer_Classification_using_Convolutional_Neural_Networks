## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
- It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Please refer the Notebook for conclusions.
